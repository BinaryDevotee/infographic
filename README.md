#Repository for Innovation Labs infographic website
To run using npm http-server
Run: 
```js
npm install -g http-server
http-server website
```

This will start up a local http server using the `website` directory as the root context of the server.

If testing locally with `infographic-node-app`, be sure to:
- access this web app via `localhost:8080`
- have `infographic-node-app` bound to `localhost:3000`

Future versions will make this more configureable.
