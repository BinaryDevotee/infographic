# Templates

This directory includes two directories, 'build' and 'deploy', which include templates for use with the OpenShift cluster life-cycle management Ansible playbook. Included with each template is an example parameter file.

Also included is an example Jenkinsfile which can be used as a starting place to create your own CI/CD pipeline.
